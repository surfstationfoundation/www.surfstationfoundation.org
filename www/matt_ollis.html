      Born and raised in Sebastian, FL Matt grew up learning everything about surfing during the "golden era" of Sebastian Inlet in the 90s. After moving to St. Augustine in the early 2000s to attend college at Flagler (and keep surfing), Matt was hired at The Surf Station to paint boards and eventually became the boardroom manager for nearly a decade. In 2012, he began a career in sales and management at GE Healthcare where he continues to work to this day.

He and his wife, Jen recently welcomed their first child, Nina to the St. Augustine community.
