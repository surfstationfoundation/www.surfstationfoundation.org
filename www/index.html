      This Saturday, August 27, the Nation's Oldest City will host an event with Surfers Healing at the south side of the St. Augustine Beach pier from 10am-4pm.
      Surfers Healing is in organization that takes kids with autism surfing, giving over 4,500 surfers and their families a day of fun in and sun in just one year.
      Throughout this event, our community will give some great kids the opportunity to experience the pure joy that is surfing.
