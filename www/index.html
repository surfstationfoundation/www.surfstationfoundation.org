    <p>
      The Surf Station Foundation is a nonprofit organization with a mission to introduce surfing, conservation, and the love of the ocean to kids who might not otherwise have that chance.
      Our goals are to evoke confidence, inspire environmental awareness, and improve the emotional and physical wellbeing of kids from disadvantaged and underserved communities, locally, and in other parts of our world.
      We also <a href="partners.html">partner</a> with, and support the efforts of other charities dedicated to helping others.
