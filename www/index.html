      This Saturday, August 27, 2022, at 10am, the Nation's Oldest City will host an event with <a href="https://www.surfershealing.org/" target="_blank">Surfers Healing</a> at the south side of the St. Augustine Beach pier.
      Surfers Healing is an organization that takes kids with autism surfing. They've given over 4,500 surfers and their families a day of fun and sun in just one year.
      Throughout this event, our community will give some great kids the opportunity to experience the pure joy that is surfing.
      The Surf Station Foundation is making a financial contribution to Surfers Healing, and the St. Augustine Boardrider's Club will be on the scene, volunteering their time and skills.
