      We are saddened to announce the loss of our dear board member Tania Schmidt-Alpers, who passed away this year.
      Tania served on the Board of Directors of Surf Station Foundation since its inception.
      She had a heart of service and her passing is a huge loss to the Foundation and to all who knew and loved her.

      In 2016 and again in 2017, Tania was recognized by the American Institute of Family Law Attorneys as one of the "10 Best Attorneys" for Florida.
      Tania closed her private law practice to work in-house with Betty Griffin Center, continuing to represent victims of domestic and sexual violence in civil legal proceedings.
      Tania was active in systemic advocacy through Pro Bono appellate cases resulting in the creation of new case law for survivors of domestic, sexual and dating violence throughout the State of Florida. This was truly her passion and life's work.
