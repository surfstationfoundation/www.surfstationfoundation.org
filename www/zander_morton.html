      Zander Morton started surfing at age five. By 10 he had his first sponsor (The Surf Station!), by 17 his first ESA East Coast Championship, and by 18 his first byline -- a travel narrative about a trip to Haiti for SURFING Magazine.
      He's since worked as associate editor for Transworld SURF, editor-in-chief at SURFING Magazine, and field editor for SURFER.
      While he recently spent 14 months abroad in Bali, he now splits time between Saint Augustine and Encinitas, CA, where he's selling houses and writing for STAB.
