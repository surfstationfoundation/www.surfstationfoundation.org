      Ross was born and raised in North Florida, growing up on Vilano Beach where his parents instilled in him a love for surfing and the ocean from an early age. After more than a decade competing in amateur and professional surf events—and gaining firsthand experience in the industry while working at The Surf Station—Ross went on to build an 11-year career in marketing with Vans.

      At Vans, he began in wholesale account marketing before moving into a leadership role managing the Go-To-Market Surf strategy across North America. In this position, he oversaw the brand's athlete roster and major events such as the U.S. Open and the Vans Triple Crown of Surfing, while also directing product launches, content creation, and philanthropic initiatives.

      Following seven years in California and extensive international travel with Vans, Ross returned home to St. Augustine. Today, he channels his deep local roots and global experience into his career as an active Realtor, helping clients achieve their real estate goals along Florida's coast.
